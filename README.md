# Challenge 3: PyPoll Election results

## Overview of Election Audit

In order to review the voter turnout by county we need to process the data again. We want to see the percentage of votes
from each county and determine the county that had the highest turnout.

## Election Audit Results

* There were 369,711 votes cast in this election.
* The raw numbers of the votes are as follows:
    * Jefferson: 10.5% of votes (=38,855)
    * Denver: 82.8% of votes (306,055)
    * Arapahoe: 6.7% of votes (24,801)
* As you can see Denver county had the most votes cast at 82.8%
* The raw numbers of votes per candidate are as follows:
    * Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
    * Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
